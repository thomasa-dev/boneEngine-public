## About
boneEngine is a community modification-based game built with the Godot game engine. It solely relies on community-made content that are custom maps, custom spawnable items, player-modifications, vehicles, weapons or anything you can think of! Although there is no built-in vehicle system for the game I plan on working on one in the future. Meaning that you can make vehicles easier for your maps.

## Contribute
If you would like to contribute and customize the game to your liking feel free to do so! All you need is Godot and knowledge in GDScript. However, if you would like to see your feature in the official build of the game feel free to message me on twitter @thomasa_dev with a link to the Github repo and the full game build with your feature/customization. There is no limit to what you want to make but there are some standards your creation will need to meet before being added.
### Standards

* Keep changing the games source code to a minimum
  * Only exception is if it contains a UI linked to settings, pause menu, main menu or the player UI
